# MarkerAR

This is an iOS sample project of a simple Augmented Reality app with Markers.

Its purpose is to serve as a mockup for those who want to learn how this technology works from inside.

It only uses OpenCV as a dependency, that is not included in the project because of its size. You can download it here:

[OpenCV Framework](https://pages.github.com/).

You can print and use any square marker on the internet like this one:
